# DocViewer Todo

## Note! Theese aren't promises and just a way for me as a developer to keep track of things i want to implement, keyword want.


- collapsable sidebar and if no json collapsed by def and if json uncollapsed by def

- add no-json div to sidebar anyway.

- allow taking "compressed" value and turn into the required data, note this requires remaking how the script finds if a param/data is given.
